# 🛍️ Product Recommendation System

A **Product Recommendation System** that suggests personalized products to users based on their preferences, interactions, and historical behavior.

This system uses machine learning techniques (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models) to analyze user and product data, and then generate relevant product suggestions — improving user engagement and enhancing the shopping experience. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧾 About the Project

Recommender systems are designed to help users find the most relevant products from large catalogues – simulating suggestions similar to what e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and others do. The recommendation logic can be based on user preferences, similar users’ behavior, product metadata, or a combination of techniques. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧠 How It Works
Load Dataset – Import the data with user interactions and product information.

-Preprocess Data – Clean and format the data for use in models.

-Model Training – Use collaborative filtering or content-based algorithms to train a recommendation model.

-Make Predictions – Generate recommendations for given users or scenarios.

-Evaluate Results – Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, precision/recall to assess performance.

## 📊 Dataset
-Explain the dataset used — format, columns, source, etc. For example:

-userId: Unique identifier for a user

-productId: Unique identifier for a product

-rating: User rating for the product

-timestamp: Time of interaction
